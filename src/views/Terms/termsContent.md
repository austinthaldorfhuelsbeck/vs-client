# Terms of Service

Last updated November 1, 2023

Vowsuite, Inc. ("Vowsuite," "we," or "us") offers an online video delivery platform through its website located at [vowsuite.com](https://vowsuite.com) and other online services (collectively, the "Services"). These Terms of Service ("Terms") cover your use of the Services provided by Vowsuite, including without limitation during free trials, on the website and associated domains of [vowsuite.com](https://vowsuite.com) and on Vowsuite web, mobile, and TV applications.

By using or accessing the Services, you're agreeing to these Terms and our [Privacy Policy](https://vowsuite.com/privacy) (collectively, this “Agreement”). If you're using the Services for an organization, you're agreeing to this Agreement on behalf of that organization, and you represent and warrant that you can do so. References to “you”, "your” and similar terms are construed accordingly in this Agreement. If you do not agree to all the terms in this Agreement, you may not use or access the Services.

We have tried to make this Agreement fair and easy to understand, but feel free to contact us if you have any questions or suggestions.

## 1. Creating An Account

### 1.1. Signing Up

In order to use the Services, you must first create an account (“Account”). You agree to provide us with accurate, complete and updated information for your Account. This includes signing up for any private or public ‘Betas’. We may need to use this information to contact you.

### 1.2. Safety

You're solely responsible for any activity on your Account and for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your password. We’re not liable for any acts or omissions by you in connection with your Account. You must immediately notify us if you know or have any reason to suspect that your Account or password have been stolen, misappropriated or otherwise compromised or in case of any actual or suspected unauthorized use of your Account.

### 1.3. Minimum Age Requirement

The Services are not intended for and may not be used any individuals under the age of 18. By signing up or using the Services, you represent that you're at least 18 years old.

## 2. Your Content

### 2.1. Your User Content Stays Yours

Users of the Services (whether you or others) may provide us with content, including without limitation text, photos, images, audio, video and any other materials (“User Content"). Your User Content stays yours, except for the limited rights that enable us to provide, improve, promote and protect the Services as described in this Agreement.

### 2.2. Optimizing Content

When you provide User Content via the Services, we optimize the content, which may include images, photos, or videos, by resizing and compressing the media for the purpose of providing a smooth and optimized experience for your clients (collectively, the “End Users). By using the Services, you grant us permission to compress and resize your User Content for the purpose of optimizing the viewing experience. For example, we might compress and resize the images provided for album backgrounds and covers to generate thumbnails and optimized versions to perform better on mobile devices or slow network conditions.

### 2.3. Client Access Period

When you deliver a project to your client, they get 10 years of included cloud and download access (with 1 year of source-file hosting). Your clients will be informed via email 6 months prior to the end of their cloud access period to extend their cloud access further. If they don't extend their cloud access period further within those last 6 months, their content will be permanently deleted.

### 2.4. Source-File Hosting Period

The deliverable also comes with 1 year of included source-file hosting. Once the 1 year period is over, the source-files are permanently deleted. They must be downloaded in that first year period. After the 1 year period, transcoded versions are still available for download.

## 3. Content Restrictions

You may not upload, post, or transmit (collectively, "submit") any User Content that:

- Infringes any third party's copyrights or other rights (e.g., trademark, privacy rights, etc.)
